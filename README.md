**Eleventh** is a turn-based card game inspired by FIFA’s Ultimate Team cards and the strategic style of Soccer Manager.
Players build their own dream team using collectible cards, manage tactics, and compete in tactical duels against other managers. 


## Notice

This is the 2nd version of this project and this is under maintenance.
Since the 2nd problem of the PBL differs a lot in architecture from the 1st one,
this is needed a new major version with possible breaking changes.

Now, this is possible to use HTTP frameworks, so QuickAPI will be deprecated.
Since the focus now is fault-tolerant system, I'll choose Typescript (Deno) or Elixir
to handle this correctly.

If you need to see the old project, open the `v1.0.0` tag version,
open on Github or do this using git commands.


## PBL Context

This project was developed for the subject TEC502 – Concurrency & Connectivity, which is taught using a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach.

In PBL, students work in groups to solve open-ended problems, progressing step by step through research, discussion, and implementation. This project in specific is individual, but sessions are organized in group to share experiences and brainstorming.

Because of this nature, I've created the `.project/` folder that have the sessions summaries, goals and others.
